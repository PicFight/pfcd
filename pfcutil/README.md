Package pfcutil provides picfight-specific convenience functions and types.
A comprehensive suite of tests is provided to ensure proper functionality.

This package was developed for pfcd, a full-node implementation of Picfight which
is under active development by Company 0.  Although it was primarily written for
pfcd, this package has intentionally been designed so it can be used as a
standalone package for any projects needing the functionality provided.
